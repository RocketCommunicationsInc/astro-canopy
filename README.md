# Astro/Canopy Collaboration

A simple environment for building and testing a basic, static HTML based web application using the new [Astro Components](https://github.com/RocketCommunicationsInc/astro-components-stencil)

NOTE: This is a barebones setup for testing purposes. It doesn’t account for production builds, testing, linting, etc … The only dependency is a light-weight http node server for internal testing.
